# Hipolabs_Project

Project aim: Creating a simple UI which displays list of people with their job positions and profile photos. The UI also allows users to search listed people by their names or positions.

Language: Kotlin

1.  I created models by using hipo.json file that is provided.
2.  I used recyclerview to list objects. I displayed each object as a cardview. Each object has three fields in its cardview: Name, Profile Photo and Job Position.
3.  I put a search button to action bar of the app that enables users to search people by their names and positions.

Note: All personal info that I use in the project are either provided to me (with json file) or already public (from google search engine:)).
